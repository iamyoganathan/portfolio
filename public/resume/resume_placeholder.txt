This is a placeholder for the actual resume PDF.

To replace this with a real resume:
1. Create your resume PDF using a tool like Canva, Google Docs, or LaTeX
2. Name it "gokul_resume.pdf"
3. Place it in the /public/resume/ directory

The resume should include:
- Personal information and contact details
- Professional summary
- Work experience (including the AI/ML internship)
- Education (B.Sc. Computer Science, MCA)
- Key projects (MyAnimeTracker, RAG Assistant, StudyPro)
- Technical skills
- Certifications and achievements

Make sure the PDF is ATS-friendly with:
- Clean, simple formatting
- Standard fonts
- Proper section headings
- Bullet points for lists
- No images or graphics that could break parsing

The interactive preview on the resume page will showcase all the key information, while the PDF provides the downloadable, formal version.
